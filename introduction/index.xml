      <description>Intended Audience This guide is intended for Node.js developers who want to develop Zeebe client applications in JavaScript or TypeScript.
Familiarity with ES6 JavaScript or the TypeScript programming language, Node.js, and a working development environment are assumed.
Configuring your TypeScript transpilation is out of scope. For that, consult the TypeScript documentation.
What this guide covers This guide walks you through using the JavaScript client for Zeebe, giving you the practical steps to write a fully-fledged Zeebe client application using either ES6 JavaScript or TypeScript.</description>

      <description>Zeebe is a highly-scalable, cloud-native microservices orchestration engine that uses BPMN to orchestrate microservices.
Polling model Zeebe clients communicate with a Zeebe broker cluster through a gateway. Communication between the JavaScript client code and the gateway is over gRPC. That means that your client applications poll the gateway for available tasks. The Zeebe broker does not invoke your microservices over REST. If you come from a REST architecture background, or have an existing REST microservices architecture that you want to orchestrate, you should take the time to understand the Zeebe model as it is, before trying to figure out how to use it with RESTful services.</description>
